## About

I am a Systems Engineer at Northrop Grumman and a Master's student in Data Science, graduating in May 2026. I am actively transitioning into AI and machine learning roles focused on applied ML, LLM applications, and data-driven systems.

I have spent the past several years working on complex, high-reliability programs, including the Sentinel ICBM, the Constellation-class frigate, and the Antarctic Research Vessel. My work sits at the intersection of systems engineering, software, and data, with an increasing focus on building practical AI and analytics tools that scale.

Recently, my work has included building LLM and RAG ingestion pipelines, automating workflows with Python and SQL, and developing internal tools used across teams. I enjoy problems where engineering rigor, data, and real-world constraints all matter.

**I am looking for AI, ML, or applied data science roles where I can build real systems and continue growing as an engineer.**
